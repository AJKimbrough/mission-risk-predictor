## ðŸ”¹ How to Use Labels
- Each issue should have at least **one label**.  
- Combine labels for clarity:  
  - Example: `MVP` + `backend`  
  - Example: `scenario` + `blocked`  
- Review labels during sprint/iteration planning to keep priorities clear.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Customization
- Labels can be edited in **Issues â†’ Labels**.  
- Add colors that visually separate categories (e.g., `bug` red, `scenario` purple, `MVP` blue).
